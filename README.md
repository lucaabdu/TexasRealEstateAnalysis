# Texas RealEstate Analysis
This repo contains an exploratory descriptive analysis of a database containing information about 4 different cities in Texas from 2010 to 2014. 
**realestate_texas.csv** is the data source. **TexasRealEstate.Rmd** is an RMarkdown file that contains the base *.Rmd* code that generates the TexasRealEstate.html file once it compiles.
**TexasRealEstate.html** is the the html file containing the thorough analysis that I have performed.
